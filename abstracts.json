        "abstract": "<p>A classic result of Turaev says that tangles on ribbons can be described as the free ribbon monoidal category generated by one object. This tells that the category of tangles on ribbon is universal in the sense that it is free on tortile Yang-Baxtor operator. Virtual Tangles are a higher dimensional version of tangles. Recently, Brochier showed that virtual tangles have universal properties similar to classical tangles. Virtual tangles also have a \"knot theoretic\" description in terms of circuit algebras. In this talk, we show that one can see virtual tangles as wheeled props, which is rigid props or equivalently, a type of strict rigid symmetric monoidal category generated by a single object.</p>",

Profinite words provide a way to speak about limiting behavior of finite words with respect to deterministic automata. In order to connect this notion of profiniteness to the λ-calculus, we consider higher-order automata which can process arbitrary simply-typed λ-terms as their input. Existing notions of automata on words and trees are then obtained as special cases.\n</p>\n<p>\nOur main contribution is the study of the notion of parametric λ-term in the sense of Reynolds. We establish a link with profinite words in the double cartesian closed category of finite sets, functions and relations, which corresponds to deterministic automata. We prove that in this setting, the notion of parametric λ-term essentially coincides with the classical notion of profinite word.\n</p>",

        "abstract": "<p>\nWe extend Lawvere-Pitts prop-categories (aka. hyperdoctrines) to develop a general framework for providing algebraic/categorical semantics for non-classical first-order logics. Instead of fixing the interpretation of quantifiers via adjoint conditions, we view quantifiers more generally as variable binding operations and explore what conditions on quantifiers are necessary to still encode the semantics in a nice 2-category, where theories are objects, structures are morphisms, and structure-preserving maps are 2-cells. After providing some examples, we showcase two results for the general prop-categorical semantics. First, we extend the homomorphism theorem from universal algebra, which gives an orthogonal factorization system for the underlying 1-category of the semantics. Then, for non-classical logics with prop-categorical semantics, we provide a novel characterization of the closure of a class of structures under their common first-order theory, which mirrors Birkhoff's characterization of the closure of a class of algebras under their common equational theory. This result is unique to the prop-categorical semantics and does not hold, for example, in the Tarskian semantics of classical first-order logic. The prop-categories we consider are much more general than traditional intuitionistic prop-categories or triposes. Nonetheless, to our knowledge, our results are still new even when restricted to these special classes of prop-categories. This talk is based on joint work with Yoshihiro Maruyama.\n</p>",

        "abstract": "<p>\nSeveral different topoi have played an important role in the development and applications of synthetic guarded domain theory (SGDT), a new kind of synthetic domain theory that abstracts the concept of guarded recursion frequently employed in the semantics of programming languages. In order to unify the accounts of guarded recursion and coinduction, several authors have enriched SGDT with multiple \"clocks\" parameterizing different time-streams, leading to more complex and difficult to understand topos models. Until now these topoi have been understood very concretely qua categories of presheaves, and the logico-geometrical question of what theories these topoi classify has remained open. We show that several important topos models of SGDT classify very simple geometric theories, and that the passage to various forms of multi-clock guarded recursion can be rephrased more compositionally in terms of the lower bagtopos construction of Vickers and variations thereon due to Johnstone. We contribute to the consolidation of SGDT by isolating the universal property of multi-clock guarded recursion as a modular construction that applies to any topos model of single-clock guarded recursion.\n</p>\n\n<p>j.w.w.

Central to this is the \"Koszul sign rule\", a signed version of the middle interchange law of the tensor product.

Then I will give a definition for a monoidal 2-supercategory and explicitly define such a monoidal structure on the 2-supercategory \\(\\mathrm{SAlg}_k\\) of superalgebras over the field \\(k\\), supermodules and morphisms of supermodules.

        "abstract": "<p>In several of his papers, F. William Lawvere comments extensively on 19th-century German philosopher G. W. F. Hegel, and in other texts, he uses terminology that seems to be drawn from Hegel. This is somewhat surprising, as Hegel has relatively little to say about mathematics in general, and few mathematicians have shown any interest in his work. (Presumably as a result of Lawvere’s references to him, Hegel now has a page on the nLab.) In the historical literature on category theory, the influence of Hegel on Lawvere and thereby on the development of category theory has received little attention. I propose to present work in progress on this little-known strand of the history of category theory. I will quickly sketch some aspects of Hegel’s philosophical work that may have captured Lawvere’s interest, in particular his dialectical account of logic as the “becoming” of concepts. I will then examine some of Lawvere’s references and allusions to Hegel in his published writings. Finally, I will try to extract some suggestions from Lawvere’s use of Hegel as to what a dialectical approach to mathematics should look like.</p>",

I will explain how these can be introduced graphically as pairs of (pseudo)monoids and (pseudo)comonoids interacting together. I will show how the correspondence between representable multicategories and monoidal categories can be made explicit graphically.\n</p>\n<p>\nThen, I will introduce some generalisations of multicategories: by allowing for many outputs giving rise to <i>polycategories</i> and a correspondence with models of classical multiplicative linear logic (\\(\\ast\\)-autonomous categories); by performing an horizontal categorification with a <i>virtual double category</i> being seen as a many-object-many-vertical-arrow multicategory; by having tensor products being parametrised by a choice of multimap in some other multicategory yielding the notion of <i>pushforward</i> in a fibred multicategory. For all of these, I will explain how to extend the graphical representation. In the polycategorical case, I will show the connection with the proof nets of linear logic. For virtual double categories, I will recover some notions already used in the literature.

From a categorical point of view, this means that the category \\( \\mathbf{LieAlg}_{\\mathbb{F}} \\) is <i>action representable</i> and the representing object, which is called the <i>actor</i>, is the Lie algebra of derivations. The notion of action representable category has proven to be quite restrictive. For example, if a variety \\( \\mathcal{V} \\) of non-associative algebras over \\( \\mathbb{F} \\) is action representable, then \\( \\mathcal{V} \\) must be the category \\( \\mathbf{LieAlg}_{\\mathbb{F}} \\). More recently G. Janelidze introduced the notion of <i>weakly action representable category</i>, which includes a wider class of categories. In this talk we explain that the category \\(\\mathbf{LeibAlg}_{\\mathbb{F}} \\) of (right) Leibniz algebras and the category \\( \\mathbf{Pois}_{\\mathbb{F}} \\) of (non-commutative) Poisson algebras are weakly action representable.

Building on this insight, we present a general polytopal coherence theorem, showing that in the presence of polytopes, techniques from discrete geometry can be used to prove coherence in a very visual and concise manner. When applied to operadic families of polytopes encoding algebraic structures up to homotopy, this theorem provides, beside coherence proofs for the associated categorified notions, a new proof that the associated operads are Koszul, and even Koszul self-dual.

Amongst the applications of diagram rewriting are the formalisation of higher category theory, higher algebra and combinatorial topology.

In this presentation, that analogy is made precise through the use of doctrines.\n</p>\n<p>\nDoctrines are a natural setting for the categorical study of theories of first order logic.  Recently, many completions of doctrines to richer syntax have been studied in the literature.  We introduce the geometric completion of a doctrine, which represents the universal addition of the syntax of geometric logic to a doctrine.  We will demonstrate the universal property of the geometric completion as well as the relationship between the geometric completion, internal locales, and classifying toposes.\n</p>",

After covering the seminal definitions and results of quantitative algebraic reasoning, I will present our recent extension that allows unconstrained operations on metric spaces and my attempt to paint the categorical picture behind it.

Given a possibly unfair coin that you know can fall on either side (i.e. an infinite sequence of i.i.d Bernoulli(p) random variables where p is unknown but neither 0 nor 1), how can you simulate a fair coin using no other source of randomness?</p>",

In particular, we will consider \\(H\\)-equivariant modules over an \\(H\\)-category \\(\\mathcal{C}\\) as modules over the smash extension \\(\\mathcal{C}\\#H\\) and discuss Grothendieck spectral sequences for the cohomologies as well as the \\(H\\)-locally finite cohomologies of these objects. We will also introduce relative Hopf modules over a co-\\(H\\)-category and discuss Grothendieck spectral sequences for their cohomologies by using their rational Hom objects and higher derived functors of coinvariants.\n </p>",
